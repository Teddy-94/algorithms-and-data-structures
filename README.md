This is a place where I put some things related to algorithms and datastructures as I learn them. This has been created by me as a tool to aid my learning. 

## Resources
The main resource I use is the Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition.

These websites have also been very helpful

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)
* [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Structure
Each folder contains a category of algorithms/data structures, with examples and text.
